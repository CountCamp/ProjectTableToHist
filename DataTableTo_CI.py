# In this script i want to animate the estimation of a population mean.
# The general idea is to use data points randomly selected from a population.
# Starting assumption is that we do not know the population mean, sd, or shape of distribution.
# so we need to make that clear to the viewers, population parameters are always unknown.
# We can only estimate them using data points.
# We can use a data table to show some the data points.
# I want to add each data point one by one to a number line.
# Using running mean, median, sd, Margin of Error, CI and skewness, we can show the mean and maybe median of the data points on a number line.
# we use two horizontal axes, one for the sample data, and one for the estimation of the population parameters.
